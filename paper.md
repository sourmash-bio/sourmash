# Summary

sourmash is a command line tool and Python library for sketching
collections of DNA, RNA, and amino acid k-mers for biological sequence
search, comparison, and analysis [@Pierce:2019]. sourmash's FracMinHash sketching supports fast and accurate sequence comparisons between datasets of different sizes [@gather], including petabase-scale database search [@branchwater]. From release 4.x, sourmash is built on top of Rust and provides an experimental Rust interface.

FracMinHash sketching is a lossy compression approach that represents
data sets using a "fractional" sketch containing $1/S$ of the original 
k-mers. Like other sequence sketching techniques (e.g. MinHash, [@Ondov:2015]), FracMinHash provides a lightweight way to store representations of large DNA or RNA sequence collections for comparison and search. Sketches can be used to identify samples, find similar samples, identify data sets with shared sequences, and build phylogenetic trees. FracMinHash sketching supports estimation of overlap, bidirectional containment, and Jaccard similarity between data sets and is accurate even for data sets of very different sizes.

Since sourmash v1 was released in 2016 [@Brown:2016], sourmash has expanded
to support new database types and many more command line functions.
In particular, sourmash now has robust support for both Jaccard similarity
and containment calculations, which enables analysis and comparison of data sets
of different sizes, including large metagenomic samples. As of v4.4,
sourmash can convert these to estimated Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI)
values, which can provide improved biological context to sketch comparisons [@hera2022debiasing].

# Statement of Need

Large collections of genomes, transcriptomes, and raw sequencing data
sets are readily available in biology, and the field needs lightweight
computational methods for searching and summarizing the content of
both public and private collections. sourmash provides a flexible set
of programmatic functionality for this purpose, together with a robust
and well-tested command-line interface. It has been used in well over 200
publications (based on citations of @Brown:2016 and @Pierce:2019) and it continues
to expand in functionality.
