----

Compute MinHash signatures for nucleotide (DNA/RNA) and protein sequences.

This is the core library used by sourmash. It exposes a C API that can be
called from FFI in other languages, and it is how we use it in Python for
building the sourmash application (CLI and Python API).

----

sourmash is a product of the
[Lab for Data-Intensive Biology](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) at the
[UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu).
