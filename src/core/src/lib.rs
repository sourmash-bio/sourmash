//! # Compute, compare and search signatures for nucleotide (DNA/RNA) and protein sequences.
//!
//! sourmash is a command-line tool and Python library for computing
//! [MinHash sketches][0] from DNA sequences, comparing them to each other,
//! and plotting the results.
//! This allows you to estimate sequence similarity between even very
//! large data sets quickly and accurately.
//!
//! [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash
//!
//! sourmash can be used to quickly search large databases of genomes
//! for matches to query genomes and metagenomes.
//!
//! sourmash also includes k-mer based taxonomic exploration and
//! classification routines for genome and metagenome analysis. These
//! routines can use the NCBI taxonomy but do not depend on it in any way.
//! Documentation and further examples for each module can be found in the module descriptions below.
